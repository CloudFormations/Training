## Course Overview

In this course, we’ll take a use case driven approach to breaking down and understanding all the data processing tools now available in the Microsoft cloud. Updating on premises SQL Server knowledge and skills to handling data using scaled up or scaled out cloud native compute and storage.

We will consider patterns for batch, stream, event and de-centralised data processing using a wide range of tools. Exploring reasons for and against the use of resources in certain situations and other patterns that you may wish to exploit for proof-of-concept environments. With many ways to build out a data product, knowing which tool is best for a given use case is a key requirement for all data engineers.

Taking an A-Z approach to all the offerings in the Microsoft cloud with key information articulated and demonstrated to inform what is the correct tool for the business requirements. We’ll build out a working set of possible solution templates as patterns for the implantation of an end-to-end analytics platform.


## Objectives

* What is it, why use it and how. For all the Azure data resources now available in the Microsoft cloud.

* To recognise the huge breadth of possible compute and storage resources now available.

* How cloud compute and storage has evolved overtime. Including a clear view on the layers of abstraction that now exists be products and experiences.

* What resources can scale up and which can scale out. Including which is better for certain use cases.

* The key differences between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Including concepts for serverless and dedicated compute types.

* To understand cost management for pay-as-you-go resources and how to predict strikes in compute.

* How to manage your wider Azure data estate and orchestrate of scalability at runtime.

* Production deliver techniques and best practices for data resource DevOps.

* How to implement security and networking for PaaS resources, ensuring additional layers of protection for data movements.
