# Compute & Storage 101 – An Engineers Guide To Every Azure Data Resource

[<< Back to Home Page](/README.md)

## Course Overview

Microsoft Fabric is a huge product suite with many data processing capabilities and many different ways to deliver data insights. The common challenge with a product such as Microsoft Fabric is not knowing where to start, but why? The answer is related to the evolution of the technology, unless you’ve followed the Microsoft tooling journey since its inception in the Azure cloud platform, as a set of discrete compute and storage resources, understanding everything that now sits in the unified product stack presents a clear skillset breath vs depth problem.

In this full day of hands-on training, we will tackle all the technical capabilities Microsoft Fabric has to offer. From the perspective of a data analyst, data engineer, analytics engineer or visualization developer. We will take an end-to-end look at the product suite and share our knowledge on how the cloud-based capabilities have matured over time. And how they fit together within Fabric.

Everything shared will be based on real world use cases and a no non-sense approach to data insight delivery. Ignoring the hype and giving you a clear pathway to get started with the implementation of data solutions using Microsoft Fabric. The workshop will include opportunities to try out a range of the capabilities getting hands on with full labs for you to start working through on the day and to take away for self-paced learning.
